RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances LLM accuracy by retrieving external data. 

Unlike Non-RAG models that rely solely on their training data, RAG systems combine two key components:
1. A retriever that searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents
2. A generator (LLM) that uses both the query and retrieved context to produce answers

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved factual accuracy through grounding in source documents
- Ability to access up-to-date information not in the training data
- Reduced hallucinations by providing concrete references
- Transparency through citation of sources

RAG is particularly effective for:
- Question answering systems
- Technical documentation queries
- Domain-specific applications
- Scenarios requiring verifiable information
